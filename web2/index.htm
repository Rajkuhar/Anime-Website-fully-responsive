            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Goku and Vegeta have gone through some tough times together. From battling Frieza, Cell, Majin Buu, and each other, their whole friendship is based on battling.

            This isn't surprising, as they are both Saiyans, a class of powerful warriors that thrive on the prospect of fighting to the finish and constantly surpassing their physical strength.
            
            One of Dragon Ball Z's ongoing themes focuses on going above all set limitations in order to reach success. Both Goku and Vegeta are constantly able to go past their limitations in the series.
            
            Goku has loving friends who glorify him as the strongest warrior around. When he transforms into Super Saiyan for the first time, it happens unexpectedly without him having to dedicate strenuous mental energy.
            
            Vegeta falls on the opposite end of this spectrum, though. Vegeta must constantly train in order to surpass his current Saiyan strength, and he begins his journey with no real friends. Sure, he later gets married, has two children, and is eventually considered a Z-Warrior by Dragon Ball Z's conclusion, but he earns all of this by making sacrifices and changing himself for the better.
            And at last they fight the villian Boo. Check him in series.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The Last till now</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Forty-one years ago, the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta is ruled by the forces of King Cold, who delegates their command to his son Frieza. King Vegeta, leader of the Saiyans, believes his son Prince Vegeta is a prodigy destined to liberate their people and rule the universe. He learns of Broly, a Saiyan baby born with an abnormal power level exceeding that of his son, and exiles Broly to the distant planet Vampa. Broly and his father Paragus, who goes after his son, are stranded on Vampa after their ships are damaged. Paragus vows to raise Broly as a mighty warrior to exact revenge on King Vegeta.

                Five years later, a low-class Saiyan warrior named Bardock becomes suspicious of Frieza and sends his son Kakarot (later named Goku) to Earth. His suspicions are confirmed when Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta after learning of a legend about a Legendary Super Saiyan who could one day defeat him. The Saiyan race is eradicated, except for Broly and Paragus, Goku and his brother Raditz, Vegeta and his comrade Nappa, and Vegeta's brother Tarble.
                
                Goku and Vegeta train on an island with Bulma, Bulla, Beerus, and Whis.Paragus orders Broly to attack Vegeta.
                
                Broly fights Vegeta and then Goku, growing stronger as the fight goes on and catching up to their Super Saiyan God forms.
                Gogeta defeats Broly and is about to obliterate him with a powerful energy wave, but Cheelai and Lemo, who had formed a friendship with Broly, summon Shenron with the Dragon Balls and use their wish to transport Broly back to Vampa. Frieza retreats, promising to return another time. Goku later meets with Broly, Cheelai, and Lemo on Vampa, wishing to be friends and providing them with various survival supplies from Capsule Corp, while also hoping to spar with Broly again and offering to teach him how to control his power.
